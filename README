Partial list of modules for http://dwimperl.com/



TODO
======

Create Task::DWIM loading all the other Task::DWIM::* modules

Further remove entries from the Modules.txt
Further split it into parts (max 100 modules per Task package).

CLI ? (command line tools)


Improve the script fetching the dependency tree so it can be ammended
manually when some optional or platform related dependencies are encountered.
(Though those dependencies might need to be added to the main list of modules
maybe with a commend why were they added)

Allow freezing the list of versions and show the difference between the
frozen list and the latest on CPAN. Allow upgrading specific modules to
specific versions or to latest (and what if it changed in the meantime?).

Go over the lists and check the commented out modules.
